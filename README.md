# contactList

This is the repository for the Contact List API that is used with my LinkedIn Learning course: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/postman-essential-training/  
You will need mongoDB set up in order to run this API.  
To use:
1. clone the project
2. run npm install
3. start mongo
4. start the API with "npm run start"
